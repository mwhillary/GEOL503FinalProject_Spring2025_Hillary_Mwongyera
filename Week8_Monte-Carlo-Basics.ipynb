    "Some useful tools:\n",
    "1. [`np.random.uniform(low, high, size)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.RandomState.uniform.html)\n",
    "2. [`np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html)\n",

    "You have laid out a (peat/mud/rock/ice) core and are measuring the thicknesses of the layers you've identified. Layer B is on top of layer A.  Your measuring tape is laid out next to the core, and you've decided you can read it to the nearest mm.  The reading at the bottom of layer A is 8 mm, the bottom of layer B is 12 mm, and the top of layer B is 15 mm. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How would you express your uncertainty in the position of the base of layer A?  What probability distribution would you use to describe it? How about the bottom of layer B?\n",
    "2. What is the thickness of layer A? What is your uncertainty in that estimate? How would you express that uncertainty numerically? How would you express that uncertainty graphically?\n",
    "3. What is the thickness of layer B and its uncertainty? What is the total thickness of both layers and its uncertainty?\n",
    "4. Bonus: Make a scatter plot of your simulations of the layer A and layer b thicknesses. What do you observe?"

    "A basaltic lava flow has been offset by movement on a fault you're interested in. You can clearly identify the edge of the flow and observe that the offset is 121 ± 16 m. You interpret that uncertainty as a uniform distribution, with the ± 16 m as the endpoints of the distribution. The age of the lava flow has been measured at 4.0 ± 1.4 ka $(2\\sigma)$. How fast is the fault moving, in cm/year, and what's the uncertainty in that rate? Provide a historgram."
